Contributing to WirePlumber
===========================

Coding style
------------

WirePlumber uses the `GNOME C Coding Style`_ with K&R brace placement
and 2-space indentation, similar to `GStreamer's Coding Style`_.
When in doubt, just follow the example of the existing code.

WirePlumber ships with a `editorconfig <https://editorconfig.org/>`_ file.
If your code editor / IDE supports this, it should automatically set up
the indentation settings.

.. important::

   When submitting changes for review, please ensure that the coding style
   of the changes respects the coding style of the project.

Tests
-----

See :ref:`testing`

Running in gdb / valgrind / etc...
----------------------------------

The Makefile included with WirePlumber supports the ``gdb`` and ``valgrind``
targets. So, instead of ``make run`` you can do ``make gdb`` or
``make valgrind`` to do some debugging.

You can also run in any other wrapper by setting the ``DBG`` variable
on ``make run``. For example:

.. code:: console

   $ make run DBG="strace"

You may also use ``wp-uninstalled.sh`` directly as a wrapper to set up the
environment and then execute any command. For example:

.. code:: console

   $ ./wp-uninstalled.sh gdb --args wpctl status

Merge requests
--------------

In order to submit changes to the project, you should create a merge request.
To do this,

  1. fork the project on https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pipewire/wireplumber
  2. clone the forked project on your computer
  3. make changes in a new git branch
  4. rebase your changes on top of the latest ``master`` of the main repository
  5. push that branch on the forked repository
  6. follow the link shown by ``git push`` to create the merge request
     (or alternatively, visit your forked repository on gitlab and
     create it from there)

.. important::

   While creating the merge request, it is important to enable the
   **allow commits from members who can merge to the target branch** option
   so that maintainers are able to rebase your branch, since WirePlumber uses
   a fast-forward merge policy.

For more detailed information, check out `gitlab's manual on merge requests`_
