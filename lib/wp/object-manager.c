/*!
 * \struct WpObjectManager
 *
 * The WpObjectManager class provides a way to collect a set of objects and
 * be notified when objects that fulfill a certain set of criteria are created
 * or destroyed.
 *
 * There are 4 kinds of objects that can be managed by a
 * WpObjectManager:
 *   * remote PipeWire global objects that are advertised on the registry;
 *     these are bound locally to subclasses of WpGlobalProxy
 *   * remote PipeWire global objects that are created by calling a remote
 *     factory through the WirePlumber API; these are very similar to other
 *     global objects but it should be noted that the same WpGlobalProxy
 *     instance that created them appears in the WpObjectManager (as soon as
 *     its WP_PROXY_FEATURE_BOUND is enabled)
 *   * local PipeWire objects that are being exported to PipeWire
 *     (WpImplMetadata, WpImplEndpoint, etc); these appear in the
 *     WpObjectManager as soon as they are exported (so, when their
 *     WP_PROXY_FEATURE_BOUND is enabled)
 *   * WirePlumber-specific objects, such as plugins, factories and session items
 *
 * To start an object manager, you first need to declare interest in a certain
 * kind of object by calling wp_object_manager_add_interest() and then install
 * it on the WpCore with wp_core_install_object_manager().
 *
 * Upon installing a WpObjectManager on a WpCore, any pre-existing objects
 * that match the interests of this WpObjectManager will immediately become
 * available to get through wp_object_manager_new_iterator() and the
 * WpObjectManager \c object-added signal will be emitted for all of them.
 * However, note that if these objects need to be prepared (to activate some
 * features on them), the emission of \c object-added will be delayed. To know
 * when it is safe to access the initial set of objects, wait until the
 * \c installed signal has been emitted. That signal is emitted asynchronously
 * after all the initial objects have been prepared.
 *

 * \parblock
 * \code
 * void
 * installed_callback (WpObjectManager * self,
 *                     gpointer user_data)
 * \endcode
 *
 * This is emitted once after the object manager is installed with
 * wp_core_install_object_manager(). If there are objects that need to be
 * prepared asynchronously internally, emission of this signal is delayed
 * until all objects are ready.

 * Flags: G_SIGNAL_RUN_FIRST

 *
 * Emitted when an object that matches the interests of this object manager
 * is made available.

 * - `object` - the managed object that was just added
 *

 *                          gpointer user_data)
 * \endcode
 *
 * Emitted when an object that was previously added on this object manager is
 * now being removed (and most likely destroyed). At the time that this signal
 * is emitted, the object is still alive.
 *
 * Parameters:
 * - `object` - the managed object that is being removed
 *
 * Flags: G_SIGNAL_RUN_FIRST

 * \endcode
 *
 * Emitted when one or more objects have been recently added or removed from
 * this object manager. This signal is useful to get notified only once when
 * multiple changes happen in a short timespan. The receiving callback may
 * retrieve the updated list of objects by calling wp_object_manager_new_iterator()

/*
 * WpRegistry:
 *
 * The registry keeps track of registered objects on the wireplumber core.
 * There are 3 kinds of registered objects:
 *
 * 1) PipeWire global objects, which live in another process.
 *
 *    These objects are represented by a WpGlobal with the
 *    WP_GLOBAL_FLAG_APPEARS_ON_REGISTRY flag set. They appear when
 *    the registry_global() event is fired and are removed by
 *    registry_global_remove(). These objects do not have an associated
 *    WpProxy, unless there is at least one WpObjectManager that is interested
 *    in them. In this case, a WpProxy is constructed and it is owned by the
 *    WpGlobal until the global is removed by the registry_global_remove() event.
 *
 * 2) PipeWire global objects, which were constructed by this process, either
 *    by calling into a remove factory (see wp_node_new_from_factory()) or
 *    by exporting a local object (WpImplSession etc...).
 *
 *    These objects are also represented by a WpGlobal, which may however be
 *    constructed before they appear on the registry. The associated WpProxy
 *    calls into wp_registry_prepare_new_global() at the time it receives
 *    the 'bound' event and creates a global that has the
 *    WP_GLOBAL_FLAG_OWNED_BY_PROXY flag enabled. As the flag name suggests,
 *    these globals are "owned" by the WpProxy and the WpGlobal has no ref
 *    on the WpProxy itself. This allows destroying the proxy in client code
 *    by dropping its last reference.
 *
 *    Normally, these global objects also appear on the pipewire registry. When
 *    this happens, the WP_GLOBAL_FLAG_APPEARS_ON_REGISTRY flag is also added
 *    and that keeps an additional reference on the global (both flags must
 *    be dropped before the WpGlobal is destroyed).
 *
 *    In some cases, such an object might appear first on the registry and
 *    then receive the 'bound' event. In order to handle this situation, globals
 *    are not advertised immediately when they appear on the registry, but
 *    they are added on a tmp_globals list instead, which is emptied on the
 *    next core sync. In all cases, the proxy 'bound' and the registry 'global'
 *    events will be fired in the same sync cycle, so we can catch a late
 *    'bound' event and still associate the proxy with the WpGlobal before
 *    object managers are notified about the existence of this global.
 *
 * 3) WirePlumber global objects (WpModule, WpPlugin, WpSiFactory).
 *
 *    These are local objects that have nothing to do with PipeWire. They do not
 *    have a global id and they are also not subclasses of WpProxy. The registry
 *    always owns a reference on them, so that they are kept alive for as long
 *    as the WpCore is alive.
